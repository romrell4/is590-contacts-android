# Contacts App (Project 1a)

In this project, I created two activities to display a list of contacts and details about a contact. I felt that a recycler view was a smart way to solve both of these issues, as it would handle the scrolling for me as well as a decent reusable layout. I also used the startActivity API to send phone calls, texts, and emails to the contact. I also used drawables to load images for each contact.
